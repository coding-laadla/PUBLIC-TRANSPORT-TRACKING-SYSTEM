# PUBLIC-TRANSPORT-TRACKING-SYSTEM
This mini project is a Public Transport Tracking System developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML, and CSS on XAMPP. It allows users to track the real-time movement of public buses without GPS by updating location data manually. The system helps passengers check bus status, route, and current stop for efficient travel planning.
